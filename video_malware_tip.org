* Check a video SIZE
/Compactar o arquivo em ~ZIP~ para uma dica de analise rápida. Se o arquivo alvo possuir ~200mb~ de tamanho, e ao ser comprimido, entre ~1-10 mb~ é um exploit preenchido para se parecer com um vídeo real./

A virus is a executable file or code that is prepended, appended or cavity injected into a legitimate file and is able to self replicate.  Once infected, that infected file can further the infection by infecting other legitimate files.  Or the infection can spread from computer to computer.  Such code or executable self replicates.  That is it is able to spread on its own and without assistance.  On the other hand, trojans need assistance to spread.  There are trojans that also prepends, appends or cavity injects malicious code into a legitimate file.  However, the action stops there and can not spread.  Such a file may be deemed "trojanized" or "patched".

True MP4 files are media files and are not executable.  They can employ embedded malicious code that may exploit Digital Rights Management (DRM) and may be classed as a trojan.  An example would be the Wimad Trojan.

If the file is 200MB in size, see if you you place it in a ZIP file and what size that ZIP file becomes.  If in a ZIP file the MP4 can be highly compressed creating a ZIP in a size "like" 1~10MB, then it may be malicious and padded to make it "large" and in that ZIP file it is small enough to easily submit to Virus Total for a report.

Sites that push nefarious Browser Add-Ons or Plug-Ins are not "ads", they are malvertisements.
